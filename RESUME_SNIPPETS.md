## 🎤 Elevator Pitch (30 seconds)

```
"FitGlyph is a full-stack fitness tracking application I built from scratch using Flask
and PostgreSQL. What makes it unique is the machine learning component - it predicts
optimal weights for your next workout based on your historical performance using a
Gradient Boosting model. I also integrated two nutrition APIs with custom relevance
scoring for accurate food tracking, and containerized everything with Docker for easy
deployment. The project demonstrates my skills in web development, database design,
machine learning, and DevOps. You can try the demo instantly at [your-url]/demo."
```

---

## 🎤 Elevator Pitch (60 seconds)

```
"I built FitGlyph as a personal project to combine my interests in fitness and software
development. It's a full-stack web application that helps people optimize their training
through AI-powered progressive overload predictions.

On the backend, I used Flask with PostgreSQL and SQLAlchemy, designing a normalized
database schema with 8 tables. The ML component uses scikit-learn's Gradient Boosting
to predict optimal workout weights based on historical patterns - things like your last
5 workouts, rest days, and volume trends.

For nutrition tracking, I integrated two APIs - OpenFoodFacts and USDA - with a custom
relevance scoring algorithm because neither API alone had complete data. This achieves
over 95% successful food searches.

I containerized the entire stack with Docker, making it easy for recruiters to run
locally, and deployed it to production with Gunicorn. The frontend is built with
Bootstrap 5 and Chart.js for interactive data visualization.

You can try it out at [your-url]/demo - it has pre-populated realistic data so you can
see all the features immediately without creating an account."
